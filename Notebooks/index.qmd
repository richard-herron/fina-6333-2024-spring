Welcome to FINA 6333 for Spring 2024 at the D'Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University!

For each course topic, we will have one notebook for its lecture and one for its in-class practice exercises.
I will maintain these notebooks here because Canvas does not render notebooks.
I will maintain everything else on Canvas (e.g., announcements, discussions, grades, etc.).

You have three choices to download or run these notebooks:

1. Download them from our shared folder on [OneDrive](https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/r_herron_northeastern_edu/Ekn1N5nzwXFDpezlTLQqLd8BBQcfvgDCkE9OgdIffHR8Cw?e=t8Dqa3) (or click the cloud icon in the left sidebar)
1. Download them from our Notebooks folder on [GitHub](https://github.com/richard-herron/fina-6333-2024-spring) (or click the octo-cat icon in the left sidebar)
1. Open them on [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/github/richard-herron/fina-6333-2024-spring/) (or click the Google icon in the left sidebar)
